[Project 1: Emotion-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Audio-files](https://github.com/mohp1-data/Emotion-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Audio-files)
Developing a Deep Sequential Neural Network model for emotion classification
Using google speech API for speech recognition
Methodology : Deep learning model building by a sequential model in tensorflow or a layer by layer way

[Project 2: transfer-learning-for-brain-tumor_classification-using-cnn-with-MRI-images](https://github.com/mohp1-data/mohp1-data-transfer-learning-for-brain-tumor_classification-using-cnn-with-MRI-images)
Using CNN to classify tumor. The dataset is very small, so we will use transfer learning method with EfficientNetB0.

[Project 3: Few-shot-Siamese-Neural-Networks-NLP-classification](https://github.com/mohp1-data/Few-shot-Siamese-Neural-Networks-NLP-classification)
In so many NLP tasks, we have low number of labeled data for classification. Zero-shot classification via transformers can also be an alternative idea to solve the task
in that case. However, the accuracy would be lower than accpted accuray. In below, I will try to use Siamese Net on NLP classification task. Siamese networks are similar 
neural networks where input vectors are passed through it to extract features , which are later passed through the triplet loss in the few shot learning process.
Siamese Net orginially were used for image processing.
